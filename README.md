# Build a Image Captioning from scratch
1. **Encoder-decoder net work**      
  * **Encoder**: Using Resnet to extract features from image.
  * **Decoder**: Using LSTM to generate the caption
2. **Attention Mechanism** To improve the alignment between image regions and the generated words
3. **Loss function**: Cross-entropy loss is typically used to measure the discrepancy between the generated caption and the ground-truth caption
